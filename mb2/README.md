# Collaborative Reality Editor

## How it works
  - Write and share thoughts, like a TODO list
  - Web app for browser
  - Through user editing and automatic data analysis processes, actionable input evolves into autonomous agents that can achieve results 
  - Stores private user and public community data in the browser (IndexedDB)
  - Private objects are not shared (new objects are, by default, private)


## Search Paradigm
  + Shared objects can be matched, and these matches return as notifications to the user and are organized as replies-to the source object
  + Objects containing indefinite properties are like persistent search queries.  
  + Imaginary objects (which act as partial queries) persist until explicitly deleted - because they can represent and track the user's intentions. 
  + Queries in the conventional Web Search paradigm, by contrast, are weak, disposable, and ephemeral. 
  + JSON Semantic representation: Language Models can translate natural language objects to JSON to enable _semantic matching_ *at scale*.  
  + Objects may include definite and indefinite semantic values, referenced in a community schema  
    + _Definite_ - describes reality as it is.  Empirical knowledge, measurements, facts, etc. 
    + _Indefinite_ - (for queries/hypothetical/imaginary objects) describes conditions/acceptability criteria that are tested for matching real objects.

## UI
  - Main View - displays content, such as an object being viewed, or edited
  - Sidebar
    + Menu
    + Object list:  When an object is clicked, opens in view.  If user is the author, then it's editable, otherwise, it's read-only
  - Views
    + **Me**: user profile (user ID, name, icon, etc...); starts as random Anonymous.
    + **Friends**: with statuses
    + **Network**: Peers, Traffic, etc.
    + **Database**: statistics, table view (with sort and filter)

# Implementation & Dependencies
 * Language: TypeScript/JavaScript (ES6+), object-oriented architecture
 * User-interface: jQuery + HTML Web Components (only ONE dynamically-generated page)
 * Uses 'yjs' for realtime CRDT WebRTC data synchronization
 * Build: 'vite'
 * Testing: 'vitest'

# Coding
 * Keep the code clear and compact.
 * Use comments sparingly, prefering self-documenting code.  Use the latest Javascript language features.  Involve no more than a few helpful common utility libraries.
 * Where possible, explore ways to generate and minimize the necessary code through clever object-oriented design and metaprogramming.
